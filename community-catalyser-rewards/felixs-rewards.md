## Context&#x20;

This is the consensus reached during a Discord discussion between a sample of “Swarm Veterans” starting at 01:02 on January 20th, 2022 and concluding at 15:54 on January 21st, 2022 UTC.

Felix did not prompt and was not a party to this discussion.

## Opening Statement

**JA:** Hello Swarm Veterans ... I would like your collaboration in carrying out a role Felix is fulfilling but without involving Felix for now. Hopefully, you'll see why once I've explained it.

Felix is doing an amazing job of bringing sustainable income to the brightest and best contributors to Swarm. However, with the character he has, he is in the awkward position of being comfortable in petitioning for the use of Swarm funds for everyone except himself. As far as I know, he still isn't receiving any income from the Swarm treasury and yet I see Felix as the most crucial person within Swarm.

Can we come up with a figure that he should be paid monthly from the Swarm treasury? I think that figure should be whatever is affordable at this stage but then scale as the Treasury increases. We also then need to make sure he pays himself or an alternate has the power to distribute treasury funds!

## **Conclusion**

Assuming funds allow and in recognition of Felix’s contribution to Catalyst Swarm we agree to reward Felix with 3 months of ADA payments at a rate of 400 ADA per week paid from the Swarm Treasury.

Start Date: 21st January 2022

End Date: 8th April 2022

Total: 4800 ADA

## **Meeting Minutes**

### **Notable points from the discussion**

**Q:** The easy thing to do would be to return the favor, 1000K month, but I am not sure this is adequate

**R:** delivery of sustainability as a target state, at least according to the contributor's locale

**V:** check swarm reserves and projections. But I believe such a reward for Felix makes total sense.

**N:** $1000/mo. makes sense. It’s not a full-time income

**G:** me and Felix have been talking about Contributors League a lot which I'm hoping we manage to get through. Confident he'll both apply and be voted in by the community as a future solution to this funding problem.

**S:** I agree - but 1000 euros per month

**JP:** wondering if that's too low - what bout 400 Euro's a week so 1600… 400 Euros a week sends a much better message than 250

**Q:** 100% on precedent-setting, not good here.

**T:** I like the idea of creating a statement of the pay he should receive because he would not pay himself. 400 ADA week is doable considering the pipeline of cashflow

**JA:** Excellent .. so unless anyone has a strong opposing/alternate voice for now we'll go with 400 ADA per week.

**T:** Should the terms hold a time? like, let’s say 3 months.

**N:** I think it’s healthy to revisit things and adjust over time. So a time limit would be good.
