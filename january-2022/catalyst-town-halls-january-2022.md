### The issue of "Rick’s picks for Catalyst Fund 7" voting - [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4efx1ZmclU\&t=348s)

The Chat during this part of the presentation ran as follows (find the full chat transcript as a doc at the end)



**00:11:56 From  Matthias Sieber**  this is all very disorienting

**00:12:00 From  Peter Van GARDEREN**   I think the potential for Cardano to be the climate change action blockchain of choice is underestimated in its ability to “reach new users and developers”

**00:12:05 From  Lauris StakePool247**  yeah, it was upsetting that ccvault project didn’t get the funding…

**00:12:30 From  Peter Van GARDEREN**  So downvoting “Climate Change: the Challenge” could be counter-productive for that criteria alone

**00:12:36 From  Melanie -Cardano4Climate** Why would we submit proposals if the voting decisions are "centralized?"

**00:12:37 From  J P**  Not all good ideas (no matter how valuable) are presented in way that makes voters see the value. This falls to the proposers

**00:12:49 From  Kriss Baird**  Voting decisions aren’t centralised?

**00:12:52 From  Zoé Kleist**  Upvote Climate challengee

&#x20;**00:12:57 From  Kriss Baird**  Who said that Melanie?

&#x20;**00:13:21 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  So how do you reach more developers.. if most of the world are not even aware of CARDANO?

&#x20;**00:13:34 From  Melanie -Cardano4Climate**  Isn't that what this slide tells the voters/ followers how to vote?\\

**00:13:34 From  Dan Verowski**  climate challenge is the most important challenge.  period.

**00:13:37 From  Phil K**  Hi all Fund 7 version of AIM voter-tool is now live. You can use the share feature to share your voter-guidance to others [https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/](https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/)

**00:13:43 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  I have no idea how to incorporate the Fund 8 goals. Is this in voting now or is it to be addressed in fund 8 voting?

**00:13:53 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  I think this tweet and the whole get rid of the “countries”challenges idea is very discriminatory

**00:14:08 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  And does not understand.. what is Catalyst and what Cardano is trying to achieve

**00:14:09 From  Stephen Whitenstall** If a single personality is presenting their recommendations is this not centralisation ?

**00:14:12 From  Kriss Baird**  This is just Ricks POV based on the criteria he’s set himself

**00:14:17 From  Rodolfo Miranda**  SSI UP !!!!

**00:14:19 From  J P**  We are more than just devs though

**00:14:36 From  Zoé Kleist** i agree @stephen

**00:14:40 From  Tomi Astikainen**  Stephen, we can all go and do the same.

**00:14:40 From  Allison Fromm**  @Rodolfo - Rick said something on Twitter about changing his mind on that one

**00:14:52 From  Phil K**  @Ale of course this is 'his' voting choice.. you can choose your own

**00:14:52 From  Mercy A**  Thanks for presenting this. Definitely opens up the conversation

**00:15:00 From  Peter Wolcott**  I PROPOSE as many people who CAN, set their own similar metrics and share – DOOOOOIT

**00:15:00 From  Tomi Astikainen**  I just generally don't like the idea of downvoting completely legit challenges.

**00:15:02 From  Matthias Sieber**  you were pretty clear on downvoting challenges that address regional issues

**00:15:12 From  Matthias Sieber**  permanently

**00:15:25 From  Peter Wolcott**  Future Challenge TEAM FUEL!!

**00:15:31 From  Vanessa Cardui**  I'm not sure these personal (and kinda discriminatory) opinions should be platformed so prominently at town hall?

**00:15:39 From  Melanie -Cardano4Climate**  Wow... all the work we are doing suddenly feels like it is wasted because the time isn't perfect. This would also feed into waiting for the governments to solve Climate change.

**00:15:42 From  Dan Verowski** why does the world need a single operating system?

**00:15:43 From  Seán Lynch**  We are not going to just clean the room, we are going to clean the planet

**00:15:49 From  Ryan Champ**  agree @ Vanessa

**00:16:07 From  J P**  Is it the system or the lack of proposer's ability to get their message across? As a CA I find it's the proposals that are the achilles heel, not the system - although of course it can be improved

**00:16:15 From  Zoé Kleist**  i mean he could have shown the importnt challenges for xyz Problem. not be like downvoting stuff … ohhh and "it is more inclusive"..?

**00:16:20 From  Johnny Nguyen**  I for one, appreciate encourage diversity of thought, but part of diversity means encouraging folks to bring their authentic views and convictions.

**00:16:21 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  What a narrow way of see this.. 🧐

**00:16:26 From  Tyler Wales**  not a single operating system; an interoperable operating framework

**00:16:38 From  Patrik Suzzi**  I see that you prioritize challenges to reach top priorities earlier. But still, I believe the "Climate Change: THE Challenge" is a very important one.

**00:16:46 From  Kriss Baird**  Folks, there is always next fund & next fund & next...

**00:16:47 From  Matthias Sieber**  it's not an open discourse if you give already loud voices an even more prominent platform

**00:16:49 From  Vanessa Cardui**  agree @alejandro

**00:16:51 From  Stephen Whitenstall**  Rest of the world = Miscellaneous

**00:16:54 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  indeed Johnny

**00:17:00 From  Kyle Solomon**  we all want the same things

**00:17:01 From  Ryan Vukich**  @vanessa yes agree.

**00:17:10 From  Ryan Champ**  diversity of thought is great! however... In general I'm not sure if any singular person's personal preferences should be highlighted on a particular platform as a means of 'diversity of thought'

**00:17:10 From  Matthias Sieber**  Kriss, there may be a fund, but people may not want to participate

**00:17:15 From  Tomi Astikainen**  So now Dor is "downvoting" all the discussions CAs and VCAs having in Telegram...

**00:17:18 From  Jose Miguel De Gamboa**  agree @Mathias

**00:17:23 From  Melanie -Cardano4Climate**  I am glad that at least Charles is thinking about the future. [https://youtu.be/zBvJiGg4iY4](https://youtu.be/zBvJiGg4iY4)

**00:17:26 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  Kriss, it feels like we've been saying that since fund 4

**00:17:33 From  Vanessa Cardui**  quite, @tomi

**00:17:33 From  Phil K**  real governance is about balancing the needs of those being governed

**00:17:35 From  Kriss Baird**  I think just because a challenge doesn’t get voted for one time isn’t disincentive to participate

**00:17:45 From  Melanie -Cardano4Climate**  Suddenly we feel centralized. once more.

**00:17:53 From  Len D**  JP, are you really saying the CA’s are the prime element of Catalyst and the proposals are simply an inconvenient annoyance?

**00:17:55 From  Matthias Sieber**  Have you been under a rock, Kriss? That's not the issue here.

**00:17:57 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  He's against growing countries, but for growing Nations....

**00:18:04 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  Reducing???? We need to EXPAND!!

**00:18:06 From  Ryan Vukich**  people may have different skills and to only accept them if they can provide near and present may not be the best path

**00:18:11 From  Peter Wolcott**  This chat needs LOVE

**00:18:12 From  Tomi Astikainen**  Two of "my" challenges are on the left but I Still disagree with this approach.

**00:18:12 From  Johnny Nguyen**  At the end of this all, we still participate by voting.

**00:18:15 From  Seán Lynch** Most important = global plastic pollution epidemic is right outside your door

**00:18:15 From  Tyler Wales**  Decentralized reputation paired with self sovereign identity would be useful for the catalyst proposal assessment process

**00:18:16 From  Emelia Sarfo**  I think Grow Africa Grow Cardano should be included

**00:18:34 From  Kriss Baird**  Everyone needs to vote for what to prioritise

**00:18:35 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  cardano challenges should ahve been withdrawn, btw

**00:18:36 From  Zoé Kleist**  for real, please just make your "picks" for topics you know about and can argument for. why make "picks" for downvotes… not cool :/

**00:18:53 From  Tomi Astikainen**  Emelia, we are not including anything Rick feels indifferent about.

**00:19:02 From  Scott R**.  Agree with Rick. There is too much going on right now. Can’t build a third level if the ground floor is not finished.

**00:19:04 From  J P**  @Len - I'm saying sometimes the greatest ideas are not presented in a way that is accessible or that are appealing to voters - it falls to proposers to explain WHY theirs must be voted in

**00:19:08 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  So experts are only on Developed Countries.. sure!

**00:19:11 From  Dan Verowski**  Rick is a decent guy. he's just signaling how important it is to get infrastructure right and solid, before communities can have at it

**00:19:17 From  Matthias Sieber**  what's the population? sample size?

**00:19:23 From  Felix Weber**  on this picklist there is still a leftover of 4M.. So still space to add challenges

**00:19:29 From  Felix Weber**         :)

**00:19:36 From  Vanessa Cardui**  Maybe the rest of us need to be Tweeting diversity and climate inspired Upvote lists

**00:19:41 From  Dan Verowski**  however one can build communities without tech!

**00:19:51 From  Juan Sierra**  improve in cardano has to do with bringing new developers and adoption.  for example, LATAM can do that, and indeed is doing it with several countries that are involved.

**00:19:52 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  So let’s have only 1 Challenge then.. 16 Million BUILD CARDANO

**00:19:52 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  Remember the work Rick did for WADA

**00:19:54 From  Johnny Nguyen**  @Vanessa yes. That’s kinda Rick’s point.

**00:19:57 From  Peter Wolcott** Thanks for Perspective Felix

**00:19:58 From  Chris Keller**  Move Voting on chain.

**00:20:00 From  Yoram Cardano4Climate**  Come on Dor…

**00:20:13 From  Tomi Astikainen**  Downvote diversity!

**00:20:16 From  Michael McNulty**  Kudos to rick for taking the initiative and having the conviction to present his views and clearly outline his thinking. Don’t think anyone should be taking this as the end all be all. Would be great to see more of these, especially if they’re expressing opposing views

**00:20:18 From  Tomi Astikainen**  Downvote women!

**00:20:20 From  Stephen Whitenstall** What people did is no guide to how they act in the present

**00:20:23 From  Tomi Astikainen**  Downvote climate change!

**00:20:27 From  Vanessa Cardui**  @Johnny - not sure about that. But it doesn't seem to be IOG's point in giving Rick's personal view such a big platform!

**00:20:27 From  Seomon blub**  I disagree with putting this on the Townhall tbh...

**00:20:28 From  Lauris StakePool247**  thanks Rick  for sharing

**00:20:32 From  Afia Owusu**  looks more like we are heading towards centralization please may be wrong

**00:20:40 From  Ryan Champ**  agreed Seomon

**00:20:42 From  Scott R**.  This list is his personal list. Not the community’s. Make your own as has been said. Pass your list around to your friends. Have spaces for your proposals. Your vote, no one else’s.

**00:20:43 From  J P**  Yup, still respect Rick's point, just too myopic for my liking

**00:21:01 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  can someone provide a transcript of this chat?????

**00:21:02 From  Johnny Nguyen**  Bring this discourse into the public sphere.

**00:21:05** From  Dan Verowski  JP 100 with u

**00:21:19 From  Jonathan Adjei**  Nice to hear your thought process Rich. I don't agree with it all, but really, Thank you for sharing.

**00:21:22 From  Jesse Caldwell**  refine through fire

**00:21:35 From  Tevo Saks**  I think its not about the amount of challenges.

Because either way there going to be 1000+ proposals

**00:21:43 From  Dan Verowski** yes John, discourse should happen in public and ideally in a restorative environment!

**00:21:44 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  Again, remember what Rick did for Wada

**00:21:45 From  Johnny Nguyen**  Communal Effort, Participation, Civic Responsibility, Radical Inclusion.

**00:21:47 From  Matthias Sieber**  Thanks for stating this so clearly, Tomi. That's exactly the message I got...

**00:21:57 From  Tevo Saks**  having such a diverse set of challenges, with several proposals each is actually much easier to decide upon

**00:21:58 From  J P**  I read the ccvault proposal and it was not well written, it got a low score for the lack of quality of the proposal, not because of the idea

**00:21:59 From  Josko Sestan**  @Rick, good work mate, you are definitely attaining the title of Expert!

**00:22:01 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  It is not the same REACH most of us has… comparing with Rick

**00:22:01 From  Dzhuliana Nikolova**  I am curious to understand why the community want more experts to provide analysis, to get to the root need.

**00:22:07 From  Dayna Kovacic**  I agree with Dor - it’s an example more than the Town Hall backing his opinions

**00:22:09 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  it is a different responsibility

**00:22:13 From  Tomi Astikainen**  Unbelievable.

**00:22:15 From  Mercy A**  Thanks @Rick for your courage

**00:22:21 From  Juan Sierra**  the issue is that Rick has 6 pools and thousends of followers.  what if a bad actor does the same?

**00:22:22 From  Yoram Cardano4Climate**  media pushing for decisions - sound familier?

**00:22:23 From  Vanessa Cardui**  @butterflytyrant - you can save the chat yourself - but I will also save and post it on a QA-DAO GitBook somewhere

**00:22:37 From  Alejandro Pestchanker**  Agree @Juan

**00:22:45 From  Rodolfo Miranda**  I’m ok with Rick’s view, but Dor, you should ‘ve also called someone from the other side to be on the stage also

**00:22:52 From  Peter Wolcott** Thanks Vanessa!

**00:22:52 From  Allison Fromm** @Vanessa you are amazing! I was just thinking to tag you and Stephen on the question of saving the chat

**00:22:52 From  Butterfly Tyrant** Thank you vanessa.  I'm short on storage.  lAlso, I'm quasar if you want to find me later.

**00:22:57 From  Dan Verowski** I can write cc vaults proposals, hit me up

**00:23:00 From  Stephen Whitenstall**  Agree Rodolfo

**00:23:05 From  Matthias Sieber**  100%, Rodolfo. Why amplify already loud voices?

**00:23:07 From  Len D**  what about projects from funds 3,4,5

**00:23:11 From  Yoram Cardano4Climate**  Agree Rodolfo

**00:23:20 From  Vanessa Cardui**  yep Rodolfo

**00:23:23 From  Len D**  where are the close out reports and videos?

**00:23:25 From  Maria carmo**  Let´s think about all the people who need help in their own language

**00:23:27 From  Scott R**.  Agree Rodolfo

**00:23:32 From  Dayna Kovacic**  We all have an ecosystem we can influence

**00:23:34 From  J P**  @Dan - I'm a MASSIVE supporter of ccvault but tech experts arent' always the best proposal writers. This is where we could also improve

**00:23:35 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  Len, for those proposals in Fund 4 - 6, you can see them in gamechanger wallet

**00:23:38 From  Dan Verowski**  Rodolfo nailing it

**00:23:41 From  Maria carmo**  I hope these people matter some how for someone in the community

**00:23:49 From  Scott R.**   Slide deck please…

**00:23:50 From  Vanessa Cardui**  @Butterflytyrant - ahah I thought it might be you :-)

**00:23:59 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  MuKn loves taking code yeah?&#x20;

**00:24:03 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  nftdao

**00:24:04 From  Peter Wolcott** 19 - presentation slides: [https://bit.ly/3IgCfgE](https://bit.ly/3IgCfgE)

**00:24:10 From  IOHK Community**  presentation slides: [https://bit.ly/3IgCfgE](https://bit.ly/3IgCfgE)

**00:24:12 From  Dan Verowski**  I love ccvault, if u have contsct w them let me know, I'd love to help em&#x20;

**00:24:16 From  Scott R.**  TY @Peter

**00:24:54 From  Allison Fromm**  Things may break......

**00:24:58 From  Butterfly Tyrant** indeed Vanessa

**00:25:05 From  Kyle Solomon** Things will break

**00:25:08 From  Peter Wolcott**  Start 00:32

**00:25:34 From  Allison Fromm**  We are clearly an anti-fragile community

**00:25:41 From  Maria carmo**  Sure

**00:25:44 From  Matthias Sieber**  are we?

**00:25:49 From  Kyle Solomon** We will be fine

**00:25:54 From  Kyle Solomon** This is all part of it

**00:25:54 From  Matthias Sieber** I'm sure you will

**00:26:04 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  Vanessa, how to contact you outside here

**00:26:05 From  Dan Verowski** relatively yes Matthias

**00:26:08 From  Johnny Nguyen** Would love to see us fund some work with Reach.sh as well

**00:26:14 From  Stephen Whitenstall**  Yes a lot people are not fine Kyl

**00:26:25 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  Yeah man, REACH is the superior language

**00:26:29 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  REACH

**00:26:30 From  Kyle Solomon**  Help me help you, Stephen

**00:26:31 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  REACH

**00:26:44 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  REACH

**00:27:33 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  reach opens up interoperability as well

**00:28:09 From  Johnny Nguyen**  that being said, I like that GLOW supports formal methods/verification… High Assurance in these early days is important.

**00:28:20 From  Chris Keller**  I crashed the car can we fix it before qualifying? DRIVE Catalyst After town hall.

**00:28:40 From  Marta L**  This is interesting…

**00:28:57 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  Hi Marta!!!

**00:28:59 From  Scott R**.  Game theory

**00:29:09 From  Marta L**  Hey Q!

**00:29:29 From  Dor Garbash**  Tomi - I used the desktop TG and I wasn’t aware it was showing the downvotes were coming from me…

**00:29:30 From  Butterfly Tyrant** Great seeing you, hope you are well!

**00:29:42 From  Dor Garbash**  I apologize, and will refrain doing so in the future.

**00:29:50 From  Dor Garbash**  Unless it’s really needed 🙂

**00:30:03 From  Kyle Solomon**  🙂

**00:30:12 From  Peter Van GARDEREN**  Looking forward to trying out Glow. Is there an updated tutorial coming out soon that incorporates this completed work?

**00:30:30 From  J P**  Can we get an update on how the flash assessments went?

**00:30:50 From  Matthias Matthijs**  +1

**00:30:56 From  Tomi Astikainen**  Dor - I don't know what you're talking about.

**00:30:56 From  Scott R**.  Does GLOW still require a Linux box?

**00:31:09 From  Stephen Macurdy**  Is there a certain limit on number of votes to cast?

**00:31:20 From  Dor Garbash**  I think you missed the point, it wasn’t about the specific opinion of Rick it was about making lists and improving the public discourse.

**00:32:05 From  Dor Garbash**  Tomi - you said earlier “Dor is downvoting everyone”

**00:32:17 From  Dor Garbash** I was responding to that.

**00:32:17 From  mike jarmon**  Never seen such a response in a TH… quite polemical, and needing a better set up I guess.

**00:33:25 From  Matthias Matthijs**  I think the real message got lost in the noise here because aparently, people might have different viewpoints sometimes and that doesn't seem so easy to be accepted. But that was not what this was about at all.           &#x20;

Everybody is encouraged to make and publish their own lists.

**00:33:40 From  Jose Miguel De Gamboa**  @Dor that's the message that went through for me. Regardless of agreeing with Rick's assesments it's a great example of "doing your homework" and encouraging healthy discussions.

**00:34:26 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  only need to vote once to receive voter rewards yes?

**00:34:29 From  Peter Wolcott**  +10 Matthias Matthijs

**00:34:32 From  Yoram Cardano4Climate**  Reach (and everyone else) join us at the event tomorrow - How can we use blockchain/Cardano for forest conservation and tree planting activities: [https://www.meetup.com/Cardano-Catalyst-Community-Network/events/283269165](https://www.meetup.com/Cardano-Catalyst-Community-Network/events/283269165)

**00:34:43 From  Butterfly Tyrant**  vote on one proposal to get the rewards yes?

**00:34:49 From  Dor Garbash**  Thanks Jose, it was on purpose to show a “dissenting” voice, because it’s important to allow diversity.
