Are you interested in joining the next debate on entrepreneurship and formalization of digital communities? Feel free to join our breakout room, in this opportunity we had the pleasure to talk with James and Nick about several issues, such as preparing to present a project at Catalyst, the importance of forming a team and the different challenges that projects go through during their development. Also, you have the Innovatio community, where you will be able to interact with other members of the blockchain ecosystem and expand your network: [https://discord.gg/wZTdAqUtz9](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video\_description\&redir\_token=QUFFLUhqbXlNMHJfcmNTdWVEZURQT2VSalNmVndjR2RzQXxBQ3Jtc0tuME1rb0JteU51YmhhMUFMVE1lcnVKcFNyX1A1TF9ucG9oTmtwWVhYQWV0V2NqTWhLRkg0ZmMxdFA0UnRWajVJMktfcWUzWGNxcXRxYkFrZUttNEphQ2R6cC1GWHNaZ3NTTmt1SVp6VFpxMzBkQjFPNA\&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FwZTdAqUtz9\&v=rDUbQjJANKU)
