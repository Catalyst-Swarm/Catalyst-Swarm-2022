### Women & Blockchain: Cross-Chain Relationships and Catalyst Onboarding

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/LSwvk3qcGS4" %}

Session N4: OneUpOneDown Breakout rooms initiative Our goal for this session was to start building a strong layer of coordination between all women initiatives within the Cardano Catalyst community. Discussion on Cross-Chain Relationships and Catalyst Onboarding brought us to the following structure:&#x20;

Structure for AfterTownHall Breakout sessions going forward:&#x20;

1\. Space to share projects, existing and new initiatives&#x20;

2\. Deep dive on a specific (pre-agreed) topic&#x20;

3\. Open discussion to understand needs (which can feed into the deep dive topic). Starting question = what’s blocking you?

&#x20;—---------------------------------&#x20;

OneUpOneDown is is a highly scalable AI mentor matching platform. Our purpose is to create trusted relationships through mentorship and our focus is particularly on women in business and technology.

Where the results will take us, what problems we choose will reveal themselves in these workshops.

In this video, we moving towards general blockchain education.

Problem Statement: Senior Market is a missing platform for educational general blockchain
