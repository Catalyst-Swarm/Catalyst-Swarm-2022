### Women & Blockchain: Cross-Chain Relationships and Catalyst Onboarding

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/LSwvk3qcGS4" %}

Session N4: OneUpOneDown Breakout rooms initiative Our goal for this session was to start building a strong layer of coordination between all women initiatives within the Cardano Catalyst community. Discussion on Cross-Chain Relationships and Catalyst Onboarding brought us to the following structure:&#x20;

Structure for AfterTownHall Breakout sessions going forward:&#x20;

1\. Space to share projects, existing and new initiatives&#x20;

2\. Deep dive on a specific (pre-agreed) topic&#x20;

3\. Open discussion to understand needs (which can feed into the deep dive topic). Starting question = what’s blocking you?

&#x20;—---------------------------------&#x20;

OneUpOneDown is is a highly scalable AI mentor matching platform. Our purpose is to create trusted relationships through mentorship and our focus is particularly on women in business and technology.
