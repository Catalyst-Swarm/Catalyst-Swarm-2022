{% embed url="https://youtu.be/iJf3xgfbdvQ" %}

The vision is to create a comprehensive overview Miro Board with various roles and perspectives. The data will be mapped on the unified backbone of the expected Innovation Fund timeline.

It will help us find clusters of overlapping pain points and foresee problems when solutions are suggested.

This session was recorded at 16.04.2022 in the Swarm Session breakout room.

Vote for Fund 8 Proposal to incentivize these workshops!! :D https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404786
