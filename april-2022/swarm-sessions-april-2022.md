The vision is to create a comprehensive overview Miro Board with various roles and perspectives. The data will be mapped on the unified backbone of the expected Innovation Fund timeline.

It will help us find clusters of overlapping pain points and foresee problems when solutions are suggested.

There is extensive discussion about Changing the Community Advisor role name in this session. Rating Proposal Feasibility seems to be the hardest thing to rate.

This session was recorded at 23.04.2022 in the Swarm Session breakout room.

Vote for Fund 8 Proposal to incentivize these workshops!! :D https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404786
